This portfolio was built with the React App

##Description

A single webpage introducing myself to prospective employers. As it is my first time using  
React it is fairly basic but the more I read the more I want to add to it!

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
