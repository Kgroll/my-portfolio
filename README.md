This portfolio was built with the React App

##Description

A single webpage introducing myself to prospective employers. As it is my first time using  
React it is fairly basic but the more I read the more I want to add to it!

##Installatation

###`npm start`Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
